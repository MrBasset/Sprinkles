Create JSON Web Server for updating configuration and monitoring. This will plug into .NET app that will manage the controller (running WPF or .NET Web Core I haven't decided).

Write Configuration to JSON file on SD card (supposed to come with ethernet sheild)

Use event framework to manage events.

Event Timer to check sensors
Event listener for web request
Event listener for control messages for servos

JSON API
/api/v1/health HEAD ??
/api/v1/status/sensor_<x>/all GET
/api/v1/configuration/sensor_<X> PUT/GET

{
	"DutyCycleSeconds" : "30",
    "StartingDurationSeconds" : "2",
    "MinimumThresholdTempCelcius" : "22",
    "MaximumThresholdTempCelcius" : "35"
}
